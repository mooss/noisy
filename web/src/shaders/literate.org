* Palette shader

This shader builds the color of a fragment from a palette transfered as a texture.
It extends the THREE.js shader implemented by =THREE.MeshStandardMaterial= and works by injecting in the vertex and fragment shader.

Code is injected in two points:
 1. Above the main function (declaration).
 2. Inside the main function (implementation).

** Vertex

Most of the magic happens in the fragment shader, where the height is used to deduce the fragment color.
The vertex shader's role is just to forward this height.

#+name: vs_palette_decl
#+begin_src glsl
varying float v_z;
#+end_src

#+name: vs_palette_impl
#+begin_src glsl
v_z = position.z;
#+end_src

** Fragment

The one role of this fragment shader is to construct the colors from the height and the color palette.

=shiftedColor= applies the =colorLowShift= and =colorHighShift= uniforms that adjusts the height to color mapping.
#+name: fs_palette_decl
#+begin_src glsl
uniform sampler2D u_palette;
uniform float u_paletteWidth;
uniform float u_colorLowShift;
uniform float u_colorHighShift;
varying float v_z;

float shiftedColor() { return mix(u_colorLowShift, 1.0 + u_colorHighShift, v_z); }
#+end_src

The color index (=colorIdx=) does some additional interpolation with =mix= to smooth out the transition between two colors.
Otherwise the change is too fast, which is particularly visible with bicolor palettes.

When there is a texture it is applied by multiplying the initial =diffuseColor= the color extracted from the color palette.
This way, the results maintains the color pattern and imprints the texture upon it.

Textures are not supported by every geometry style, so when there are no texture (no map), a flat color is used.

#+name: fs_palette_impl
#+begin_src glsl
vec2 colorIdx = vec2(mix(0.5 / u_paletteWidth, 1.0 - 0.5 / u_paletteWidth, shiftedColor()), 0.5);
#ifdef USE_MAP // Mix color and texture pattern.
diffuseColor.rgb *= texture2D(u_palette, colorIdx).rgb;
#else // Use flat color.
diffuseColor.rgb = texture2D(u_palette, colorIdx).rgb;
#endif
#+end_src
