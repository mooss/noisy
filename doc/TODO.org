* Versions

** TODO Alpha 5 (elderberry)
*** DONE GLSL in org-mode
Write GLSL code blocks and make them available in a ts file (like tips)
Maybe vendor the perl script from litlib to help with that
*** DONE Fix the surface (and maybe box) chunks slightly shifting when increasing the resolution
*** DONE Pixel render shape
*** DONE Remove noisy terracing
*** DONE Download as texture
*** DONE Textures
**** DONE Arbitrary texture (just get it to work)
**** DONE Make custom textures
*** DONE Mesh management
**** DONE Find a way to make the disgusting async chunk loading good (maybe later...)
**** DONE Reuse weavers in Chunk
**** DONE Implement a chunk pool to limit reallocation when entering a new chunk


*** TODO Slightly shift height when interpolating colors
Simplex in shader?
*** TODO Improve UI
**** DONE Minimalist, dense dark and white theme
**** DONE Dock panels on left and/or right, no margin
**** TODO Add top bar (desktop style) with buttons
***** TODO Make an export entry (texture, screenshot, JSON).
**** DONE Make tabs behave similarly to buttons
*** TODO Start setting up linter
*** TODO Rename "blocks in a chunk" to "resolution"
*** TODO Set more reasonable min, max and default values for noise parameters
*** TODO Max/union noise (take the highest value of different functions)
*** TODO Custom octaves
For instance octave 1 nad 2 are ridge, 3 and 4 are simplex.
Would mix well with max noise.


** Future versions

*** UI
**** Visual difference between cards and selection cards
Selection cards is when only the active card applies something (like with noise algos).
Akin to a radio button.
Should probably make one for checkboxes eventually.
**** Declarative GUI and store it in state

#+begin_src js
{
    'folder:a' {
        'range:fundamental': {step: 2, min:12, max: 120},
        'range:octaves': {step: 12, min: 654, max: 635646354},
    },
    'folder:b' {
        'range:persistence': {step: 12, min: 654, max: 635646354},
    }
    frequency: 23,
}
#+end_src
Encode them Using the same meta scheme as the others.
Important step to allow modifying the UI in the UI (reordering, adding layers, etc).

**** Floating notification
**** GUI warnings
**** Mobile UI

*** UX
**** Advanced mode
By default, hide complicated parameters to make the interface less intimidating.
**** Noise library/environment
A dedicated panel with a mapping from names to noise, reusable.
Should it be references, templates or both? There might be a need for both (instances/references have values and changing one will change all the others, whereas classes/templates only have default value and might need to be instanciated).
**** Scenes/presets
Propose different starting points that are more focused and less overwhelming (texture editor, montain range).


*** Noise / world generation
**** Proper clusters
Like the clunky round+warp clustering as of elderberry but good.
Would be a first step towards biomes.

*** Performance
**** Chunk computation in web workers
The framerate still drops on the Steam Deck even at 128 chunk resolution.
**** Frustrum culling
**** LOD
**** Consider using integers to define vertex positions
**** Don't launch every chunk load asynchronously (use a pool)
**** Displacement and normal mapping
***** For surfaces
***** For boxes
**** Reuse meshes / buffers (*SET ASIDE FOR NOW*)
Probably quite a lot of work.
See =stash@{0} Work on reusing buffer geometries, needs some kind of smarter meshmanagement in terrain/mesh ; On dev/dandelion: 9fc64da Always render for the first second=
More doable now that there is a pool implemented.


*** Parameters
**** Add texture filter parameter
To change paletteTex.magFilter and paletteTex.minFilter.


*** Rendering
**** Fix voxel terracing when height multiplier is changed
Make a special case somehow when changing the mult in voxel mode.
**** Hand-roll shaders
The injection leaves too little control and everything is clumsy and difficult to do.
***** Break texture pattern
https://iquilezles.org/articles/texturerepetition/
***** Cell-shading or something cartoonish or colorful
**** Ocean layer
Don't use texture under the ocean line and shade the surface with waves/whatever.


*** Features
**** STL export
**** Moon
**** Real world map (nominatim)


*** Others
**** Better URI compression when needed
***** Only store the diff
***** Dict-compress whole objects, not just leaves
It should help a lot and not be so hard.
All paths were nothing is changed would be pruned.
***** Custom quoteless string serialization format instead of JSON
**** Warn when URI length is too big (2000?)
**** Replace various callback patterns with iterators
=Coordinates.spiralSquare= for instance.
**** Go applet that works under Wayland
**** Try catch the main function and display the error message
**** Rethink low and high bounds computation
Maybe everything should be computed at the very top of the noise chain instead of this convoluted low/high/recompute recursive chain.
Will make things much much simpler so this is basically a must-have.
Add a UI to change the sampling parameters and an way to tweak the bounds up/down.
**** Chunk atomisation
Shrink / grow chunk real size (CHUNK_UNIT but can't just tie CHUNK_UNIT to a parameter, will be more complex).
**** Show dependencies and licences more proheminently


*** Out of reach
Techniques that are a bit too complex to be tackled in the short term but are worth thinking about eventually.
**** Analytic derivative
Time consuming, a lot of maths, probably requires to hand-write noise functions.


* DONE Released

** DONE Alpha 2 (bean)
*** DONE Warping
*** DONE Support arrays when encoding state
Done but unused in the end.
*** DONE Noise processing tower
*** DONE Noisy terracing strategy
*** DONE Noise processing map
*** DONE Flat rendering
Was just a question of putting the height multiplier at 0.
*** DONE Only center on avatar with follow camera when the avatar actually moves
*** DONE Store approximative position and camera in state
*** DONE Tabulate first level of folder
*** DONE New palettes
Coffe stains and rainbow.


** DONE Alpha 3 (coriander)
*** DONE Usage advice / basic explanation
Required information:
 - Interaction (mouse+WASD).
 - Documentation of parameters.
 - Brief explanation of the project and its principles (interactive procedural generation with noise, what else?).
*** DONE Show versatility
 - List of screenshot of various scenes
*** DONE Changelog
*** DONE Update README with new screenshots


** DONE Alpha 4 (dandelion)
*** DONE Fix the horrible structure of noise state
**** DONE Flatten the structure (no params and use "#meta" for the meta field)
**** DONE Flat processing chain (not the horrible nested chains of wrappers)
**** DONE Better Lexon64 size estimation
*** DONE Optimize the boxes away

Maybe later, should first find a way to remove the wasteful color array with something more reasonable (1d texture).

Look around at the neighboring cells and only make a mesh for the pertinent faces, not the whole box.
Probably requires to remove the hexagons, that's probably for the best.
*** DONE Profile and optimize mesh creation
*** DONE Asynchronous / parallel chunk rendering
*** DONE Asynchronous radius change
*** DONE (?) Use environment
Define processing steps and noise algos as variables in an environment.
Implemented as implicit aliasing encoding instead of an explicit environment.
*** DONE Fix terraces number
Currently 1 shows 2 terraces and so on.
*** DONE Cubic terracing policy (voxel terracing)
Requires env-based state, because it is necessary to know the chunk resolution, which has to be a reference.
*** DONE Spiral chunk loading
*** DONE Investigate negative heights (bad sampling?)
Tweaked the sampling a bit, but this cannot fully dissapear.
*** DONE Add some button to redisplay the welcome message
*** DONE Use texture even for flat color (if possible)
Maybe using a 1d texture indexed by the height would be possible, might require a dedicated shader though :/.
